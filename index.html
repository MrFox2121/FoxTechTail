<h2>The Pursuit of Software Engineering</h2>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I am a wizard turned software developer named Fox. I have a deep interest in advancing my career through web development. 
  My experience working with inspiring engineers and developers has motivated me to consider a future at Holberton School.
</p>

<p>
  I believe I have the mindset and determination to succeed in such a journey. 
  I am passionate about my work and would love the opportunity to work with some of the best in the industry.
</p>

<h2>Program Options</h2>
<p>
  I understand that there are four program options available:
  <ol>
    <li>Full Stack Web Development</li>
    <li>Machine Learning</li>
    <li>Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality</li>
    <li>Linux Programming, Advanced Algorithms, & Blockchain</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>My Preference</h2>
<p>
  My preferred choice is Full Stack Web Development. This field encompasses the entire scope of building and maintaining websites and mobile applications. 
  It ranges from the user interface at the front end to data management at the back end.

<h2>Goals After Holberton</h2>
<p>My goals are, first and foremost, to land an excellent position with an excellent company. I seek to find a company I can work with for a long time period. Sustainable and reliable.
I plan on getting an LLC and start hosting for AirBnB. I am also interested in the potential for travel. I have a plan to work towards building a better life for my son and I.
I would also love to take these skills and help others in many different areas of life.
